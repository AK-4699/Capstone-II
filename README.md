<h1>Tobacco Use Analysis Capstone Project</h1>
This repository contains the code and analysis for my final capstone project at Springboard. The goal of this project was to analyze tobacco use data from the CDC website to understand whether the overall use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarettes had increased, decreased, or stayed the same after the first federally backed anti-smoking ad campaign rolled out in 2012.
    
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    The analysis focused on several key factors:
    <ul>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Education Level</li>
        <li>Location</li>
    </ul>
    By examining these factors, I aimed to identify trends and provide recommendations for future anti-smoking campaigns.

<h2>Data Source</h2>
The data used in this project was sourced from survey data available on the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Data-Tobacco-Use-2011-to-pr/wsas-xwh5/about_data">CDC website</a>.

<h2>Tools and Libraries</h2>
The project was conducted using Jupyter Notebook and leveraged several Python libraries, including:
<ul>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of anti-smoking campaigns and offers recommendations for future initiatives based on observed trends in tobacco use.
